This contains the source code for the snowball compiler and the stemming
algorithms on the website.

Generate headers/sources files
-----------
go to folder /libstemmer and run

./mkmodules.pl modules.h src_c modules.txt ../mkinc.mak
./mkmodules.pl modules_utf8.h src_c  modules_utf8.txt ../mkinc_utf8.mak

go to root folder of the projectand run make 

If there were no errors during execution you should have src_c folder with the different stemmers created

If you want to add more languages, you have to create a folder inside "algorithms" folder with the language name, and put the sbl file (stem_ISO_8859_1.sbl). Then edit the modules*.txt files in libstemmer folder to add your language to the configuration (language UTF_8 langiso)
